# FPGA-experiments

This repository contains FPGA experiments conducted while learning 数字逻辑与计算机组成 (Digital Logic and Computer Organization). The experiments were done using Verilog to design various computer organization components, and culminated in creating a CPU to run a custom system.

## Experiments

- Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Sequential Circuits (D flip-flop, JK flip-flop, T flip-flop)
- Arithmetic Units (Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier)
- Memory Units (Register, RAM)
- Control Units (Simple FSM)
- CPU Design (CPU, Instruction Decoder, ALU, Register File)
- System Design (System Top Module)

## Tools Used

- Verilog
- FPGA Development Board
- FPGA Development Tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus)
