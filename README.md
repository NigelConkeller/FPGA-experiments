# FPGA-experiments

This repository contains FPGA experiments conducted while learning Digital Logic and Computer Organization. The experiments were done using Verilog to design various computer organization components, and culminated in creating a CPU to run a custom system.

## Experiments

- Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Sequential Circuits (D flip-flop, JK flip-flop, T flip-flop)
- Arithmetic Units (Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier)
- Memory Units (Register, RAM)
- Control Units (Simple FSM)
- CPU Design (CPU, Instruction Decoder, ALU, Register File)
- System Design (System Top Module)

## Tools Used

- Verilog
- FPGA Development Board
- FPGA Development Tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus)
